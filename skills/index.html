    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <div class="boxed">
      <p>Recently I have been looking for ways to market myself to employers and future employers beyond a resume and cover 
        letter. As a computer science major, I recognize the importance of having personal projects and somewhere to 
        showcase them. Because of this, I decided to learn how to make an effective personal, professional website.<br>
        For the most part, I worked on this project while sitting on my bed in my room. Because I have a very busy schedule, 
        however, I found it hard to make time for the project and often found myself working on it in the small periods of 
        time between classes and my activities. This system worked out relatively well because I could do tasks that didn’t 
        require an extended amount of focus time such as doing research or reading throughout the day, leaving video-watching
        and practice to when I was at home.</p><br>
      
        <p>Initially, I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to learn. I began researching for things along the lines of 
        “How to build your own website.” I was able to find a lot of good resources such as videos that overviewed creating
        a personal, professional website and example websites that other people created for themselves. Through this initial
        research, I found a lot of interesting topics within the broad topic of building a website that allowed me to hone
        in on specific aspects of website development. In addition, I also learned how to avoid including features that were
        overkill, made websites hard to navigate, etc. One commonly used feature that I was advised not to include in a
        portfolio were vague descriptors such as “innovative” and “hardworking.” After reading why, I understand that it’s
        more important to show how I would demonstrate one of these characteristics rather than to directly state them.</p><br>
        
        <p>After my preliminary research, some of the features I decided would make for a good professional website were a 
        resume, picture of myself, list of personal projects, and an aesthetically pleasing website. At this point, I 
        realized that my topic was a little too broad. I was reading a lot about what to include in a website and not 
        so much about how to physically create it. Because my overarching goal was to learn more HTML and CSS, I decided 
        to switch gears and focus on the “hows” rather than the “whats.” In other words, I zoomed in on specific HTML and 
        CSS features I liked from looking at websites and decided to learn how to implement them.</p><br>
    
        <p>I created a Practice page on my website to implement at a very basic level some of the things I learned. I liked the
        idea of having a blog format, so I learned how to make columns. I saw a website where the picture of the person who
        created the website was in a circle, so I learned how to make round borders and put a round border on a picture of a
        Döner Kebab I had in Germany. I then added an opacity feature to decrease the opacity when the picture was hovered
        over. Some features I learned about but struggled to include. For example, I wanted to create a favicon for my
        website, so I designed it and converted the image to a favicon format. I looked at several sources for how to make
        the favicon show up, but for some reason the code I have for it doesn’t work. I also had trouble getting the correct
        results when I tried to implement bullets on my list of sources for the curriculum of this project. One interesting
        problem I ran into was creating different cursors based on user action. I learned how to do it and implemented a
        pointer cursor when hovering over links, however when I went to test it out, I realized that the pointer cursor is
        already implemented by default. I wasn’t sure if this was due to using GitHub or just a feature included with
        internet browsers. In any case, if I ever wanted to include an unconventional cursor, I could do so.</p><br>
    
        <p>Probably the coolest source I found was a Lynda video that taught me how to design a portfolio website step by step.
        The video was interesting because it combined Photoshop with HTML/CSS. The creator of the video used Photoshop first
        to design the main page of his website and figure out how he wanted it to look when it was all said and done. After
        he was finished, he used the alignment feature in Photoshop to align everything on his website, used the eyedropper
        tool to get exact colors, and by the end his website looked exactly like the Photoshop version. Although different
        from the other sources I was using, this source proved to be the most useful in my learning process. When I
        originally created the website for this class, I didn’t really know what I wanted it to look like, so I did random
        features. Later, I realized that I didn’t like my website aesthetic and had to go back and change everything. Had I
        used the design process from this video, I could have made changes without editing code and then had a template to
        work off piece by piece. This idea is something I’ll definitely use to create my portfolio website in the future.</p><br>
    
        <p>Overall, I believe I learned a lot of great tips and tricks for developing a portfolio website. I learned what to
        include at the broad level of what makes a website professional and then zoomed in on the specific HTML/CSS
        features to make the website a reality. In addition, I now understand better how to handle my time when working on
        an extended project like this.</p>
