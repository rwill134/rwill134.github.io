    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <div class="boxed">
      <p>Every aspect of this class has been a learning experience for me. I went into the class with very
        little knowledge of the forms of digital media we covered. So, while every project has been working with an audience
        in mind, realistically this class has been more for my own personal growth. I don’t really expect what I produced to
        be anything critically acclaimed, but I am proud of myself for learning what I have in the class.<br><br>
        
        As a computer science major, one thing I have always disliked is the focus on back-end programming. The classes lack
        an emphasis on technology that appeals to the senses – visual and aural being the main two. I loved that this class
        allowed me to think about front-end aspects of technology like layout, audience, genre, etc. and while I’ve dabbled
        in such things in non-technical work, applying it to technology was a new learning experience for me in this class.<br><br>
        
        My website was the first technical project I produced. HTML is very different from other languages I’ve programmed
        in and was so intuitive that... it wasn’t. I found myself thinking way too hard, for example, about how to turn text
        white when all I had to do was type the word “white.” When designing my website, I originally focused on what a
        modern audience might find cool. I went with a black and white theme, had it running properly with all my links
        working, took a step back, and hated it. It wasn’t who I was, and as a personal website that’s probably the worst
        thing I could do. The book Writer/Designer defines organization as “the way elements are arranged to form a coherent
        unit.” My new design has a blog organization to it, and it feels like the website of a writer with the background
        images of coffee, a tablet, and a laptop, which is what I was going for as an English major. The colors are softer
        (browns, blues, and creams) and therefore indirectly expresses welcome and comfort to the audience rather than the
        harsh contrast of black and white from before. Some of the things that I was amazed I got to work were links that
        looked like buttons and embedded pictures.<br><br>
        
        In some ways, Photoshop was more difficult than the website because it didn’t have the ability to move and be
        interactive. For the first two projects, I went with a horror theme because it seemed like the easiest genre to
        pull off as a beginner. Both my cannibal tuna casserole ad and horror High School Musical posters turned out more
        kitschy than I wanted and didn’t really evoke the horror experience. The ad worked a little better with that design
        because the fact that it was an old advertisement afforded it the ability to be kind of kitschy because it spoke to
        the time and the lack of technology just as JAWS was scary to an audience in 1975. Cutting and pasting on the High
        School Musical movie poster, however, didn’t evoke horror as well. Some of the most effective edits from my
        classmates on their movie posters worked with lighting, so for my edit I tried playing with that as well, making
        it black and white and darker than the original.<br><br>
        
        One of the things I wish I would’ve done for the in-class versions of the projects was think more about what I wanted
        to do before I started. I usually did a “make it up as you go” approach but after doing the storyboard project, I
        realized the importance of process and making a basic outline or sketch before actually starting a project. I took
        this approach for my revision of the audio project. The peer feedback I received from the original “Disaster at an
        Amusement Park” audio was helpful in pointing out aspects of the piece that I didn’t realize were confusing while
        also confirming opinions I already had. This help formed the basis of my outline: namely what worked and what didn’t.
        What worked was the divide between a good day and a bad day. But my audio lacked a clear story or arch. My outline
        for the revision was a rough sketch of that story, and once I had that down, I could focus on making that world
        a reality rather than trying to build it as I went. This revision was also an example of using technology I already
        knew to my advantage. When using audacity for the original, I spent more time trying to understand the software and
        less time creating my audio. For the revision, I used GarageBand, which I am much more familiar with. That level of
        comfort then let me toy with the affordances of audio by asking myself how I could make this understandable and real
        without providing any visuals. One example of this is contrast, which Write/Designer describes as the difference
        between elements to make them stand out from one another. Not only do the two good/bad sections contrast one another,
        but each individual sound contrasts each other via noise level and ear isolation, making each noise stand out from
        one another while still forming a cohesive whole. My final result took the longest out of any of the other projects
        because I really got into it, and it is something that I feel extremely proud of.<br><br>

        I’ll be honest, I started out not enjoying my skills assignment because I realized too late that I focused on too
        broad of a topic: designing a portfolio website. My idea for the assignment was a little too ambitious for my level
        of skills with HTML and CSS. Additionally, a lot of the websites I wanted to emulate used JavaScript, which I
        couldn’t do. I switched my focus about halfway through to learning how to code different features that could
        eventually compose a portfolio website. Deep down, what I really wanted was to learn more HTML and CSS that I could
        eventually apply to the portfolio website. So, while the result of the skills assignment, a few features on a
        practice page, isn’t amazing, I actually gained a lot of knowledge on what looks good on a portfolio site: i.e. 
        pictures, simplicity, mission statements, and I learned techniques for how to create those different aspects so 
        that now I could do a Skills Assignment Part II on my own and design a website using the techniques I learned. 
        Additionally, for this assignment, I missed that I had to make smaller posts about my progress. While I can’t make up
        for that because I am no longer in the moment, I will say that I learned a lot about the importance of having an
        achievable goal and a process to meet that goal, especially after my “mid-project crisis.” I now know that when
        doing an independent project, designed solely by me, I need to make sure that what I want to do is directly
        achievable. Building a portfolio website was achievable, but for me it was more than a one-step process to get there.<br><br>

        Overall, I would consider the knowledge I gained in this class to be the stepping stones to improve upon and learn
        new modes of technology. My computer science classes can be dry and boring, and I sometimes question why I am
        interested in technology at all. This class has re-inspired me about the vast capabilities of technology, and I am
        excited to further explore what I learned in this class on my own.

    <h2>Showcase of Revised Work</h2>
      <div class="boxed">
        <p> <b>1. An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience.</b><br><br>
            
            For my High School Musical Poster edit, I tried to turn the Disney movie poster into a horror genre movie poster.
            I added faces from scary movies, a fire pit for the characters to jump into, a spider web, broken lights in the
            lettering, and changed the colors to black and white. However, I think the changes I made ended up being
            overkill, and the poster looks more kitschy and funny than the creepy vibe I was going for. Part of this is
            because I didn’t realize that most of the experiences an audience around my age would have with High School
            Musical would be humorous because it was the popular, silly, Disney movie that every middle schooler loved.
            In the same way that Twilight is now a joke, so too is High School Musical, which makes it harder to turn the
            movie into something scary. If I were to remake this poster, I would feed into the comedic aspect of the movies
            and make a parody poster for the films, highlighting some of the outrageous personalities in them. I think a
            goofy looking movie poster for a parody would be humorous to any viewer but especially to someone that watched
            the movies. Additionally, I would’ve liked to alter the title in some way to fit the genre.<br><br>
          
            <b>2. An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the 
              visual mode.</b><br><br>

            For my logo project, I decided to make a logo for the old bookstore, Borders. Initially it was just a stack of
            books with a tablet on top. However, for my revision I wanted to make the logo more distinct to Borders. I
            decided to add the original Borders logo to the bottom of the stack of books. I also discovered that their
            motto was “Beyond Books.” This excited me because it fits perfectly with the idea of technical progressivism
            that I was going for. I decided to add the motto to the screen of the tablet. The original tablet was turned
            off, so I changed the colors to light blue to make it look like it was turned on and that the words were
            appearing on the screen. Had the motto not been significant, I probably still would have added some different
            icon or text to the screen of the tablet because I wanted that to be the focal point of the piece.<br><br>

          <b>3. An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another.</b><br><br>

          For my Borders logo, my original design was a stack of books with a tablet on top. I liked this because one of the
          reasons Borders went out of business was because they didn’t progress technologically as well as bookstores like
          Barnes & Noble. In my logo, I incorporated the tablet to compare the way users read in the modern age vs the more
          traditional way. Today, we often read the news on a website rather than in a newspaper or a story on an ebook
          rather than a printed book. The tablet symbolizes this change. However, I also wanted to convey the idea of
          keeping to our roots, so-to-speak, and the roots of Borders, which is the paper book. Thus, the logo passes the
          messages of catering to the more traditional style of reading while making an effort to progress with technology.
          By doing so, the logo would hopefully reach a wider audience.<br><br>

         <b>4. An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked.</b><br><br>

         My Photoshop project of the veggie tuna casserole was particularly frustrating because it was my first time using
         Photoshop. Photoshop has a ton of options for editing photos, but it wasn’t intuitive to me how to use them.
         Things that should have been simple like undoing an edit, or editing a photo’s size and shape proved to be very
         difficult. Additionally, the whole concept of layers was foreign to me. One tool I completely abandoned was the
         magnetic lasso because it kept getting caught on parts of the image that I didn’t want it to get caught on and that
         frustrated me. For this project, I decided to stick with the most basic tools that I could figure out how to use
         such as the eyedropper for getting colors, the paint can for painting larger sections, and the paintbrush for 
         drawing graffiti-like letters. Later, I figured out how to crop images by changing layers after getting help from
        some of my classmates who were more familiar with the inner workings of Photoshop.<br><br>
           
        <b>5. An example of something you are particularly proud of</b><br><br>
        I am proud of my “Disaster at an Amusment Park” clip because I’ve made a lot of significant changes from the
        original piece. The original was about 45 seconds of a happy day at an amusement park and has a crash come at the
        very end. The story, that a roller coaster crashed, was not very clear. For the revised version, I added a clearer,
        more outrageous story arc and split the shift from good to bad more evenly. Using GarageBand, which I’m more familiar
        with than Audacity, allowed me to greatly expand on the sound editing of the project. One of my favorite features
        I incorporated is making sounds come distinctly from the left or right by isolating speakers. This way, I could have
        “controlled chaos” meaning that although a lot is going on at once, each individual sound is still very clear.
        If I were to revise this further, I would work more with volume control and fading to make the sounds even more
        realistic.<br><br>
