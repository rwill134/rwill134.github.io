    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <div class="boxed">
      <p>My approach to the media-focused assignments in this class has been to be as creative, 
        and sometimes bizarre, as possible. This encourages me to think outside the box even when sticking to a 
        theme or genre.<br><br>
        
        For my Photoshop projects, I decided to go with an old-school, corny horror theme. For my first assignment, 
        I didn’t have any experience with Photoshop, so I mainly focused on learning basic tools and applying them to 
        my project. I changed an old ad for veggie tuna casserole to be cannibalistic. Aside from being creepy, this 
        revision was also poking fun at the vegetarian dish by turning it into a carnivorous one. I did some cutting and 
        pasting from other photos such as using the head of a boy. The drips from the can were also originally paint on a 
        paintbrush. I then changed the color of certain objects to red to add to the horror theme. Doing so proved to be a 
        little tricky because there were a lot of small, different colored objects that I wanted to blend together into one 
        red object. Lastly, I edited some of the pre-existing text in the ad by changing the word “meatless” to “meatFULL.” 
        I purposely used a simplistic graffiti style to do this.<br><br>
        
        My second Photoshop project was changing the classic Disney movie from my pre-teen years, High School Musical, 
        into a horror movie. Using one of its movie posters, I changed the faces of some of the characters to classic horror
        characters such as the clown from American Horror Story and the doll Annabelle. I also included a fire pit 
        underneath because the characters are jumping, so I thought it would be scary to have them essentially jumping to
        their deaths. One of the most difficult aspects of this project was changing the “G” in the logo to look like it
        was dangling. This required cutting out the letter, changing it to a different layer, and repasting it back in so 
        that it blended in. Although this poster was supposed to be scary, I realized that it was more comical. I think 
        this is mostly because I am not an expert at Photoshop so some of the edits looked very kitschy. I think if I 
        was a little more experienced, I could have achieved the full-on horror theme.<br><br>
        
        For my storyboard, I decided to focus on the topic of Public Domain. I decided to draw my storyboard rather than
        use pre-existing images because I felt that it gave me more freedom to be creative. The idea behind the story was
        to have a guy named Jerry who is worried about downloading a Shakespeare play off the internet for free. Then the
        “Public Domain Fairy” appears and takes him back in time to show him why it’s okay for Jerry to do this. While 
        making my storyboard, I realized very early on how time-consuming the drawing approach is. I didn’t get very far
        because I was so focused on drawing the pictures, and it is more difficult to draw with a mouse than with a pencil.
        That being said, I was still more satisfied with the result so far because it was more original than if I had used
        other images.<br><br>
        
        My audio project was the project I decided to revise for this work-in-progress-2 assignment. I really enjoyed
        playing with the different sound-clips and experimenting with how they worked (or didn’t work) together. I had
        some trouble using Audacity, but I am skilled with GarageBand, so I decided to revise my audio on that platform.
        My original audio clip was called “Disaster at an Amusement Park.” The premise was: It is a sunny, happy day at
        an amusement park when suddenly a rollercoaster goes off its tracks, causing havoc. I had it set up that the
        majority of the 1-minute clip would be the happy day, with the destruction happening at the end. After sharing
        my clip with the class, I received a lot of great feedback that made me rethink my design. First, the destructive
        part of the audio had the biggest response so in my revision, I decided to make a little less than half of the
        video the peaceful day and lengthened the destructive portion. Doing so also allowed me to experiment more with
        crowd reactions within the audio, another downside to my original project. Finally, I decided to make more of
        a story out of my audio. Initially, I wanted to keep the story of a rollercoaster going off the tracks but make it
        more meaningful. I searched for (literally) hours for audio clips of a mother and child interacting because I
        wanted to have the story be that the mother lets her kid ride a rollercoaster, gets on her cell phone after the kid
        is gone, and then hears the crash. Because I couldn’t find any audio to make this work, I decided to zoom out to the
        crowd and do something a little bit crazier. I found a website with a ton of robot audio clips, which really excited
        me. I decided to change my story to: “It is a peaceful day at an amusement park when suddenly a robot-alien invasion
        occurs.” This story idea worked really well. In the peaceful part, I included a lot more random ambient sounds. I
        kept the cell phone ringing from the original idea, and added some whistling and laughter. In the destructive half,
        I included robot voices, laser beams, and timed blasts so that people reacted immediately to them. One of my
        favorite parts of the editing process was changing different sound effects so that it sounded like they were coming
        from different directions. I did this by muting one speaker or the other. The final result has a smoother
        progression and better reactions and story.<br><br>
        
        Lastly, I did some edits to my website to make it more readable. I included breaks between links so they don’t 
        bleed together, and I changed the text color and background color to improve readability.
