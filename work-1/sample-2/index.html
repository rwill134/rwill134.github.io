    <h2>Website Design Idea</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="boxed">
    <p>For me, engaging websites are those that are simplistic enough that the messages or information they are trying to 
      convey stand out. Visually, this may include a theme of basic colors with a vibrant accent color and stylish, 
      yet not too daring, buttons and fonts. What makes websites memorable are animations such as those implemented with 
      hover and unique design elements like a different mouse or innovative layout.</p><p></p>

    <p>I would like my design to feel simplistic yet warm and comforting. Instead of having one color as the background, 
      I’ll instead use a background image. I would like to use a light accent color of aliceblue and keep the rest of the 
      color scheme to whites and browns. Another source of color in my website might be images that I’ve taken, having the 
      images and text organized into one or two columns. I’d also like my font style to be similar to a paper newspaper, 
      using a font like Courier New to accomplish this. My ideal audience would be people that are interested in both 
      writing/literature and technology.</p>
