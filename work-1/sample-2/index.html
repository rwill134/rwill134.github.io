    <h1>Website Design Idea</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="boxed">
    <p>For me, engaging websites are those that are simplistic enough that the 
      messages or information they are trying to convey stand out. Visually, this may include a theme of 
      basic colors with a vibrant accent color and stylish, yet not too daring, buttons and fonts. What makes 
      websites memorable are animations such as those implemented with hover and unique design elements like a 
      different mouse or innovative layout. 
      I would like my design to feel simplistic and modern. Instead of having one color as the 
      background, I’ll instead use a faded black and white image. I would like to use a neon color for the 
      accent, but only implement the accent in places such as the scroll bar, in between links, etc. 
      Another source of color in my website might be images that I’ve taken, having the images and text 
      organized into one or two columns. I’d also like my font style to be similar to a paper newspaper, 
      using a font like Bookman Old Style to accomplish this. My ideal audience would be people that are 
      interested in both writing/literature and technology.
