    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <div class="boxed">
      <p>I have approached the assignments in class so far with thoughtfulness and creativity. I have a poor habit of
        subconsciously putting up a mental block on my creativity for fear that what I write won’t be good or come out 
        the way I intended it. In the first assignment where I made a fake Craig’s List “For sale” post, I 
        tried to just let my imagination run wild with only minor tweaking later. In addition to being creative, 
        I tried to stay true to myself in the “About Me” section, valuing my interests over something that might make the 
        page seem “cooler.” In this way, I hope that my website gives off an air of authenticity. This is the approach I 
        hope to continue to take with the rest of the creative writing-based assignments.</p> 
        <p>When it comes to my website, 
        I originally wanted a modern, simplistic feel because I tend to like websites I see online 
        that are like this. I implemented a black and white theme and immediately disliked it. It felt too 
        formal and stiff, and that doesn’t match my personality. While I’m still working with simplicity, I wanted to give
        my blog a warm, comforting feel to it. I implemented a new color scheme of browns and whites and included a 
        background with wood, coffee, a laptop, and pen and paper. My new design looks more like a blog and feels more 
        personal to me. Because I changed my design idea slightly, I had to revise my original design idea post to be
        more fitting to this theme. For my current design, I have included margins and buffers in the text of the body to 
        make it look like it is being written on the wood surface of the background. I am using white text with aliceblue 
        details. I decided to make my links look like buttons, adding a slight change to white when the mouse hovers over 
        them and small shadows behind them to give the links contrast from the background. I implemented two sets of links. 
        The first for the main menu are in-line orientation across the top while the second menu for my work-1 writing 
        samples are organized in a vertical orientation. I did this to distinguish between the two menus. Around my text, 
        I’ve implemented a box outline with a groove as the line. My hope is that the box separates the text from the rest 
        of the page and, in the event of multiple posts on a page, would make each post stand out. I went with the all-caps, 
        Copperplate font for the headers of my web pages. For the body text font, I used Courier New. I liked the newspaper 
        vibe that this font gave off, and I felt that it was unique yet plain enough that it would not be distracting or 
        difficult to read. On my “About Me” page, I included a picture of myself standing in front of the Shakespeare and 
        Company store in Paris. I chose this picture because it fits with the theme and is representative of my interests 
        in writing and traveling. Two of the most challenging aspects of creating my website were making sure the links 
        went to the appropriate pages and adjusting the alignment and spacing. In particular, it was difficult to size 
        the image of myself right so that I didn’t look disproportionate. While not physically difficult, it was also 
        hard to choose a color scheme for my website. I went through a lot of trial and error to find something that I 
          liked.</p> 
        <p>Moving forward, I would like to understand picture properties better. For example, I would like to 
        know how to insert an image without changing the background image. I would also like to learn how to align 
        multiple images and work with stylizing images to have borders or filters. In addition, I would like to work with 
        columns and learn how to have one column at the top of the page and two at the bottom. Stylistically, I want to 
        learn how to emphasize certain elements of my website. Right now, everything is very uniform, which looks nice, 
        but I wonder if emphasizing certain elements would make it look better. I’m thinking of playing around with font 
        colors and sizes to do this. Lastly, I would like to take my audience into consideration when thinking about user 
        accessibility. I want my audience to be able to easily navigate from page to page and have the style overall work 
        well enough that the content of the website is the main focus.</p>
